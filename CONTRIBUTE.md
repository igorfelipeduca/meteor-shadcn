# Contribution guide

This is a project that has the purpose of creating a documentation on how to use shadcn with Meteor. In this initial state ([see commmit](https://github.com/igorfelipeduca/meteor-shadcn/commit/0dfd7606db465a53ee8f104d39aa1cc94f82fc72)), the shadcn installation and components are working just fine, but their styling is messed up.

### Installation

To install the project, take a look at [README](https://github.com/igorfelipeduca/meteor-shadcn/blob/master/README.md) and follow the steps described on it.

### Goals

- [ ] Fix the style of the components
- [ ] Automate the converting from ts to js process
- [ ] Create a documentation for each one of the components in their ready to use state [like this one](https://github.com/igorfelipeduca/meteor-shadcn/blob/master/README.md#2---install-the-button-component).
